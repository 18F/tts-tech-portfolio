## Director

_[Original job post](https://join.tts.gsa.gov/join/technology-portfolio-director/)_

The Director does the following:

- Official GSA Supervisor responsibilities, such as:
  - [Leave approvals](https://handbook.18f.gov/leave/)
  - [Performance management](https://handbook.18f.gov/performance-management/)
- Solutions leadership responsibilities, such as:
  - Attending Senior Management Team (SMT) meetings
- Ensuring the team members feel supported as individuals
- Ensuring the team is supported by other leadership
- Ensuring the team fulfills its various [responsibilities](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/tech-portfolio/), including meeting deadlines
- Resolving conflicts within the team, including being a tie-breaker when needed

To make the team as flat as possible (avoiding [command and control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control)), the Director shares the following responsibilities with the rest of the team:

- Determining strategy
- Setting vision/goals/deadlines
- Assigning tasks (self-organizing preferred)
