## Overview

TTS Tech Portfolio oversee/manage/coordinate everything technology-related that cuts across TTS, or anything technology-related that will affect TTS from the outside.

## How we operate

- We work in the open, with rare exceptions
- We follow the Amazon model of [reversible decisions](https://fs.blog/2018/04/reversible-irreversible-decisions/)
- Issues in the board should be split to be _size:_ weeks, and ideally _size:_ days
- We try to minimize [toil](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/eliminating-toil/) and having to be reactionary for TTS and especially ourselves
- We optimize for team member happiness and productivity
- All meetings have a shared notes doc (if they aren't over Slack), and have clear action items following
