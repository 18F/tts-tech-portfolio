## Ceremonies and Activities

We use the term "sprint" to refer to the ceremony cycles, even though they aren't strictly Sprints in the Scrum sense.

### Standups

**Cadence:** Daily at 11:30 ET

**Format:** Virtual Meeting

**Purpose:** Ensure folks are making progress within their assigned Initiative areas and that people aren't blocked.

At the individual level, it's important to walk into the day's stand-up prepared. It keeps the energy of the stand-up high and everyone engaged.

**Meeting Flow:**

1.  Each team member gives an update on:
    1.  Activity updates
        1. Past
        1. Current
        1. Future
    1.  Current blockers, things that need feedback, cards that you're waiting on others in order to progress
    1.  Any help needed
    1.  Review of calendar items that others might benefit from attending to knowing about

#### What to work on

Recommended order to prioritize cards:

1. `In Progress`
1. `Blocked/Waiting` that can be moved forward / broken up
1. `Ready` with upcoming due dates
1. Other `Ready`
1. `Backlog`, particularly cards that:
   1. Force-multipliers, i.e. where we can spend a little time now to save a lot of time in the long run
   1. Solve active pain points over nice-to-haves
   1. Are quick wins
   1. Are part of an [Epic](#epics)

TIP: Look for [anything with a due date](https://github.com/orgs/18F/projects/11?fullscreen=true&card_filter_query=due+label%3A%22due+date%22).

NOTE: Look for work that is missing from the board. If you mention you're working on something and it isn't represented, someone will probably ask a follow up question.

NOTE: This activity relates to the following measures within the Performance Plan

- Business Unit: Delivers great work (Customer Satisfaction & Relations), (Productivity & Volume)
- Duty Specific: Works well with others (Communication Skills), (Helps Others)

### Lunches

**Cadence:** Tuesdays & Thursday at noon ET

**Format:** Virtual Meeting

**Purpose:** Team bonding/culture-building.

We talk about whatever we want, work-related or not. We avoid talking about day-to-day tasksâ€”that's what Standups are for.

Opportunity to do some lean coffee style discussions to talk about areas of interest that folks want to hear from others.

NOTE: This activity is purely optional and will have no impact on an individual's performance plan.

### Pre (Sprint & Grooming) Ceremony Activity

**Cadence:** Before Sprint or Grooming Ceremony

**Format:** Async

**Purpose:** Come prepared to the Sprint Ceremony

- Add cards to the board
  - related to your Initiative
  - related to Working Groups
  - etc
- Make sure all the current In Progress/Waiting/Blocked cards are up to date and reflect the current status
- Groom Cards
  - Cards in the Ready (Sprint Planned) column + the columns to the right must be Groom Accepted
  - Cards in the Backlog (Sprint Staging) column must be Groom Final and ready to be Groomed Accepted
  - Cards in the Icebox column must be Groom Draft
- Cards in Backlog (Sprint Staging) column + the columns to the right must be assigned
  - Check to make sure cards in your Initiative are assigned

TIP: Have the relevant [template](https://github.com/18F/tts-tech-portfolio/issues/new/choose) filled out when creating a new card.

TIP: The person who created the issue doesn't have to be the one to groom it or eventually be assigned to it

TIP: Should have enough work to keep yourself busy for the next two weeks. Keeping in mind the current In Progress/Waiting/Blocked cards, any upcoming leave and pre-allocated work.

TIP: Try to keep cards 'right-sized' and scoped to be started and finished within the Sprint.

TIP: You can groom move a card to Backlog (Sprint Staging) while it is still in Draft; but it should be groomed ASAP.

NOTE: Ideally this activity is done by noon on Friday before the Planning Ceremony to give teammates enough time to review. Also helps the Project Manager feel prepared going into the Sprint Planning ceremony.

NOTE: Be especially diligent about adding cards that you would like to include into the new Sprint.

NOTE: This activity relates to the following measures within the Performance Plan

- Business Unit: Improves Resource Management (Quality Management)
- Duty Specific: Demonstrates agility, adaptability, and resilience (Planning & Agility)
- Duty Specific: Works Well (Meets Deadlines), (Dependability)

### Planning Ceremony

**Cadence:** Every other Monday 13:00-14:00 ET

**Format:** Virtual Meeting

**Purpose:** Move cards from the Backlog (Sprint Staging) to Ready (Sprint Planned). Expect that the cards that are planned for will be the activity that gets worked on within the next couple of weeks unless there is a task that needs to be expedited.

**Meeting Flow:**

12 minutes: Speed Stand-Up

4 minutes: Staging

Move cards into the Backlog (Sprint Staging) that you would like to discuss adding into the Sprint

Teammates will order the cards assigned to them in the Backlog (Sprint Staging) based on their own criteria

- [Alyssa](https://github.com/orgs/18F/projects/11?fullscreen=true&card_filter_query=assignee%3Aits-a-lisa-at-work)
- [Hoaian](https://github.com/orgs/18F/projects/11?fullscreen=true&card_filter_query=assignee%3Ahoaiandang)
- [John](https://github.com/orgs/18F/projects/11?fullscreen=true&card_filter_query=assignee%3Ajjediny)

16 minutes: Card Review Ready (Sprint Staging)

Review cards of other teammates

- Skim through any background information
- Check for missing User Stories
  - Clearly lays out what problem is being solved
  - Captures all the perspective users
- Validate the Size as being realistic
- Achievable Acceptance Criteria
  - Clear what it would take to close the card
  - Easy to imagine what the end product of the card would be

4 minutes: Approve other's cards

- If approved
  - React with a 'thumbs up' emoji on the card body
- If not approve
  - Indicate what else needs to be done in a comment

10 minutes: Sprint Discussion

- Are any cards missing in the that should be listed?
- Are there any lower effort cards that can be added?
- How much is this Sprint going to move the needle for your initiative?

2 minutes: Decide which cards should get moved over to Ready (Sprint Planned)

- Project Manager will add designated Sprint Milestone to cards
- Project Manager will move over cards for teammates

2 minutes: Wrap-Up

TIP: Cards that are not likely to get done this Sprint should go at the bottom of the stack.

TIP: Start from the top when reviewing cards.

TIP: Filter for cards that are Groomed Final before starting a review and exclude cards assigned to yourself.

TIP: As you are reviewing teammate's cards; make comments directly in the card; but you may also ask simple questions for the sake of clarity. (That's why we're doing this together as a group!)

### Grooming

**Cadence:** Every other Monday 13:00-14:00 ET

**Format:** Virtual Meeting

**Purpose:** Maintain non-planned or in-progress cards.

**Meeting Flow:**

12 minutes: Speed Stand-Up

10 minutes: New Card Review
Teammates will brief others on the new cards they created and the group will decide where the card should go Icebox or Backlog (Sprint Staging).

### Reviews

ON HOLD

### Retros

**Purpose:** An opportunity for the team to inspect itself and identify possible improvements.

[Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AllRE0PWduc_Blu1bt5RWMqIbjbkROzlEugqZ089VTg/edit#)

## [The board](https://github.com/orgs/18F/projects/11?fullscreen=true)

**Purpose:** Show what is and isn't being worked on, and to help keep ourselves from taking on too much at once, individually and collectively.

The board structure is inspired by Kanban.

### Cards

**Purpose:**

- Remind ourselves what problem we are trying to solve

- Establish a scope that is completable sooner than later

Also known as an "issue". A card should be created when a task:

- Is the responsibility of the Tech Portfolio (versus something like a personal HR-related task)
- Will take more than 30 minutes
  - Shorter tasks can be added (such as "schedule meeting around X"), but is not required
  - Not necessary for things like recurring or TTS-wide meetings. For example: we don't have cards for each of our ceremonies.
  - Beware of tasks that seem quick ("email someone about X") but commit you / the team to follow-on conversations/work.
- Would otherwise be lost as an action item in an email, meeting notes, Slack, etc.

If there is a repository that the issue is specifically applicable to, create it there. Otherwise, default to [creating in the tts-tech-portfolio repository](https://github.com/18F/tts-tech-portfolio/issues/new/choose). [Add it](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/adding-issues-and-pull-requests-to-a-project-board) to the project board.

- Cards with a due date should have a suffix of `- due [date]` in the title and the `due date` label.

### Labels

We have a couple set types of labels. Beyond those, you are also welcome to add whatever labels are useful to you. The labels are [configured as code](terraform/).

In order to allow for continued asynchronous work as much as possible, if a person needs feedback on an issue, use the label `feedback needed` and tag in the person and provide a synopsis of what feedback you're looking for.

#### [Grooming status](https://github.com/18F/tts-tech-portfolio/labels?q=groom)

**Purpose:** Indicate the state of the issue itself.

See [Grooming](#grooming).

### Columns

Ideally, issues move left to right, with the exception of Blocked/Waiting. There is no team-wide vertical ordering of issues in any column, though individuals are welcome to do so.

| Column                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Max per person                  | Issue entrance criteria                                                       |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New                     | Newly created Issues land here automatically.                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                 |                                                                               |
| Icebox                  | Issues here should be prioritized top-to-bottom amongst the initiative.                                                                                                                                                                |                                 |                                                                               |
| Backlog (Sprint Staged) | Issues that are immediate priorities. Expect to accomplish within the next 2 Sprints. Once they move into this column, they either get moved into a Sprint and advance to the Sprint Planned column within 30 days or they get closed. | 4                               | Must be assigned                                                              |
| Ready (Sprint Planned)  | Issues to be worked from this column. Team conscience, no blockers, and no prerequisites. What the team is going to work on next. Planned at the Sprint Planning ceremony.                                                             |                                 | Must be groomed                                                               |
| In Progress             | Issues that are being actively worked on                                                                                                                                                                                               | 12, though fewer is recommended | Must be [groomed](#grooming)                                                  |
| Feedback/Waiting        | Issues temporarily moved into this column. Expect to move in and out quickly. Something that is actively being worked on and it is with someone else for the moment.                                                                   |                                 | Must have explanation of what it's waiting on                                 |
| Blocked/Watching        | Issues that are waiting on someone outside the team; out of our control to get done. Want to keep an eye on it, but not likely to be responsible for it to be done.                                                                    |                                 | Must have explanation of what it's waiting on                                 |
