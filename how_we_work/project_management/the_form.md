The audiences could be guilds, product managers or technical practitioners. Updates would typically include things that someone following along closely with our work might care about and might be included in newsletters.

The **All TTS Dashboard** is information intended for all of TTS for information that is relevant to all folks. The target audience is the 350+ folks that sit within TTS and might be interested in updates that might affect them.
