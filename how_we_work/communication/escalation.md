# Escalation

Time to time, we have the need to escalate things within GSA IT. A few rules for doing so:

- Only do so after the user has tried getting the issue resolved through the [Service Desk](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/gsa-internal-tools/#it-service-desk)
- Include the ticket number(s)
- Only the Tech Portfolio should do so, so that we aren't bombarding them

Who to escalate to:

- Mac admin rights requests - nathaniel.ciano@gsa.gov
- Mac software/OS issues - cemacteam@gsa.gov
- GSA software requests/licensing - swlm@gsa.gov
- Service Desk tickets being stuck generally - dawn.shelton@gsa.gov
