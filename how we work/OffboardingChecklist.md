# Offboarding Checklist

## Instructions

When someone leaves the cloud.gov team

1. Create a new issue in the private team repo called "Remove [person's name]".
2. View the raw source of this file
3. Copy everything below the line into the new issue's body
4. Replace "LeavingPerson" with the leaving person's name
5. Submit the issue
6. Assign the issue to the person who bravely volunteered to handle the person's offboarding
7. Put the issue into the "In Progress" pipeline in Zenhub

---

In order to complete LeavingPerson's exit from the cloud.gov team, the assignee should complete a prescribed set of tasks that will remove any special access.

# Directions:
**Assignee:** The tasks below are organized by the role needed to complete them. If you canâ€™t complete any of the items on your checklist personally, _you are responsible for ensuring that an appropriate person does it_.

For compliance tracking purposes we need to show _when_ offboarding actions happened; many need to occur in a 24-hour window. As you do this work, comment on this GitHub issue as you complete each task. (PS-4: Personnel termination)
