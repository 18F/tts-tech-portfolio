# Onboarding Checklist

## Instructions

When someone new joins the TTS Tech Portoflio team:

1. The TTS Tech Portoflio director or deputy director adds the new team member to the `tts-tech-portfolio` team in GitHub. This constitutes 'formal approval` by leadership and enables access to to the [Tech Portfolio GitHub repos]({{site.baseurl}}/github-repos) for the next step
1. Create a new card in the [Tech Portfolio Github repo](https://github.com/18F/tts-tech-portfolio/issues) called "Onboard [NewPerson]".
2. View the raw source of this file.
3. Copy the text before the checklists to the Description field of the card.
3. Copy each applicable block of tasks into a its own new task list on the card, replacing "NewPerson" with the new person's name and  "Buddy" with the onboarding buddy's name.
4. Submit the card.
5. Assign the person who bravely volunteered to be the new person's Onboarding Buddy to the card.
6. Put the issue into the _In Progress_ column.

---

In order to get NewPerson productively contributing to the TTS Tech Portfolio team, Buddy should help NewPerson complete a prescribed set of tasks that will bring them up to speed.

## Directions

**NewPerson and Buddy:** Try to go through your checklists in order.

**Buddy:** If you canâ€™t complete any of the items on your checklist personally, _you are responsible for ensuring that someone with the correct access completes that item_.

## New Person checklist
